# Editing

Agent Client allows AI agents to edit files in your vault and working directory.

## How Editing Works

When you ask the agent to modify files:

1. The agent proposes changes
2. You see the proposed edits in the chat
3. The agent may request permission to apply changes
4. Changes are applied to your files

## Permission Controls

Some agents request permission before performing certain actions. When a permission request appears:

1. Review the proposed action
2. Select one of the available options provided by the agent

::: tip
Permission options vary by agent. Some agents may not request permission at all and edit files directly.

### Auto-Allow Permissions

In **Settings → Agent Client → Auto-allow permissions**, you can automatically allow all permission requests from agents.

::: warning
Use with caution—this gives agents full access to your system without confirmation prompts.

## Viewing Changes

The chat displays file changes with:

- **File path**: Which file was modified
- **Diff view**: What was added/removed (when available)
- **Status**: Success or failure of the operation

## Best Practices

1. **Use version control**: Keep your vault in Git before letting agents edit
2. **Review changes**: Check diffs before confirming major modifications
3. **Start small**: Test with minor edits before complex changes

## Undo Changes

If an agent makes unwanted changes:

- Use **Editor**: Cmd/Ctrl+Z in the affected file
- Use **Git**: `git checkout -- <file>` or `git restore <file>` (if your vault is version-controlled)
